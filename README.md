# Predicting The Vancouver Housing Market Using a Neural Network

## In this repository you will find four scripts:

**Functions.R** <br />
This script contains contains custom functions that were written specifically for this project.

**Data_Generation.R** <br />
This script generates housing market data based on a variety of parameters that can be modified. 

**Neural_Network_4.R** <br />
This script runs a neural network on 4 variables, each variable has a high impact on the housing market.

**Neural_Network_6.R** <br />
This script is essentially the same as Neural_Network_4.R except that two new variables are introduced, "smell" (how the neighborhood smells), and "block" (the average length of the blocks in the neighborhood). These two new variables have little to no impact on the housing market data and the idea with this script is to see if the neural network can recognize that fact.
